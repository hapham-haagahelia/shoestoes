            <p> The Shoes & Toes is a professional dance company dedicated to artistic excellence and education, reflecting Helsinki’s diverse communities. At Shoes & Toes Ballet, children shine on stage through our modern adaptations of classical ballets in two annual performances: "The Pop!Nutcracker” and a spring PopBallet!

                    The company was founded in February 2002 by Hannah Abigail, the first of its kind in Helsinki in more than 40 years. Helsinki Ballet brings a contemporary vision to the treasured art form of ballet, with repertory and programs that revitalize and re-imagine the classical form. Our mission is three-fold: to commit to artistic accomplishment, education, and community engagement.

                    <p>The Company continues to create and perform new repertory bringing Helsinki audiences the artistic excellence they’ve come to expect. And through our Education and Community programs, Helsinki Ballet creates opportunities for new audiences to experience an aspect of culture which they may otherwise never have had access to. In 2011, Helsinki Ballet opened the doors to its first permanent home at The Schermerhorn, a residential development in downtown Helsinki. </p>
                    <p>Built and managed by Common Ground and The Actors Fund, The Schermerhorn provides supportive housing for artists of all disciplines. Our ground level space provides Helsinki Ballet with our own storefront dance studio, access to a 99-seat blackbox theatre, dressing rooms, and administrative space.</p>
